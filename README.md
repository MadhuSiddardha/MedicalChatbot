# Medical Chatbot: Your Virtual Health Guide üåüüè•ü§ñ

## Overview
This project is a **Medical Chatbot** designed to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms and offer medical advice accordingly. The chatbot is built using **Gradio** for the UI, **PyTorch** for the machine learning model, and **Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing.

## Features
- Accepts user-inputted symptoms and predicts possible diseases.
- Provides medical advice and recommendations for each predicted disease.
- Implements **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for symptom analysis.
- Uses an **RNN-based model** for disease prediction.
- Interactive **Gradio-based** web UI for easy access.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **PyTorch** (For Machine Learning Model)
- **Scikit-learn** (For Data Processing)
- **Gradio** (For Web UI)
- **Pandas** (For Data Handling)
- **NLTK** (For Text Vectorization)

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install gradio torch pandas scikit-learn nltk
```
## How It Works
1. The user inputs their symptoms in natural language.
2. The text is processed and vectorized using **NLTK**.
3. The pre-trained **RNN-based model** predicts the most probable disease.
4. The chatbot responds with the disease name and corresponding medical advice.
5. The chatbot also handles **greetings** and **farewell messages** naturally.

## Example Interaction
**User:** "I have a severe headache and nausea."

**Chatbot:** "Based on your symptoms, I believe you are having *Migraine*. I advise you to identify triggers, manage stress, and consider pain-relief medications. For a more detailed diagnosis, please consult a doctor."

## Notes
- This chatbot is for **educational purposes only** and should not be used as a replacement for professional medical advice.
- The disease predictions are **probabilistic** and may not always be accurate.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset with more diseases and symptoms.
- Improve NLP processing with advanced techniques.
- Implement **speech-to-text** functionality for hands-free interaction.
- Deploy as a **web-based service** for broader accessibility.
